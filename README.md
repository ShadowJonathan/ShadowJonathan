`$ whoami`

Someone interested in systems (of all kinds, not just computers), who does programming on the side, and sometimes makes a thing or two.

Currently relatively focused on [matrix](//matrix.org), supporting it on the side via [ruma](//ruma.io), poking it from all sides.

I love to work in Rust. :green_heart: :crab:
